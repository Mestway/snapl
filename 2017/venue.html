The per person total of $1476.64 (single occupancy) includes the 3-night stay (accommodations) beginning on May 7th, 3 meals per day, conference costs, and ALL applicable fees & taxes. The cost per room is roughly $200 per night for single occupancy. Our agreement with the venue is for only a bundled package but we broke down the costs as best we could to provide some information on per night room costs. Double occupancy and guest rates also include all meals and conference costs (except alcohol).

      <p>Check-in time is 4:00pm on Sunday, May 7. Guests arriving after Sunday should pick up their room keys at the
		  front desk of the Social Hall main lobby.</p>

      <h3>Parking</h3> 
      <p>Parking is open on a first come, first served basis. Parking Lot D is the closest parking lot
		  to both our meeting space and lodging. There are multiple parking lots on Asilomar's grounds, as well as free
		  street parking with Sinex Avenue being the closest street to our area. See the map for parking lot and street
		  parking locations.</p>
