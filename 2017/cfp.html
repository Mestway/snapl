			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>
The <i>Summit oN Advances in Programming Languages</i> (SNAPL) is a biennial venue for discussions about programming languages. SNAPL focuses on experience-based insight, innovation, and visionary ideas spanning from foundations to applications of programming languages. We welcome perspectives from both industry and academia.</p>

<p>SNAPL complements existing conferences by emphasizing discussion.  Each SNAPL talk will be followed by a two-minute round table discussion leading to a plenary Q&A session.  A good SNAPL contribution is thus equal part an insightful paper and equal part an engaging talk.</p>

<p>Practitioners and researchers are encouraged to submit an eight-page contribution on a programming languages topic. The program committee looks for submissions that will lead to a stimulating, thoughtful or even (gently) provocative discussion.  (Imagine that you are applying for an invitation to give a key note speech.)</p>

<h3>Submission Requirements</h3>

<p>Submissions must include a cover page with authors' names, affiliation, justification statement and attendance statement. Papers not including these risk desk rejection. The justification statement should briefly explain why the submission is appropriate for SNAPL and summarize the new/different paradigm, perspective, or position. The attendance statement must specify which author(s) commit to attend upon acceptance/invitation, and who will present the work.  SNAPL requests a commitment for designated presenters because a good SNAPL contribution is more of a keynote address than a regular paper, which means that the presenters need to be able to guide the discussion during and after the presentation.  We expect the author teams to select their best speaker, who is not necessarily the most senior author. The cover page is part of the package given to the reviewers, hence SNAPL submissions are not double-blind.</p>

<p>SNAPL welcomes contributions about visionary ideas requiring years of exploration and evaluation, progress on an ongoing, long term research program, lessons from a completed project, including design mistakes, well-argued challenges to accepted ideas and methods, an unexpected connection between two areas of programming languages or a new line of research that builds off of other areas of Computer Science or other disciplines. This list is not intended to be exclusive.</p>

<p>The submissions must be formatted using the <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/" target="_blank">LIPIcs style</a> and must have no more than eight pages (excluding bibliography and the cover page), which is equivalent to roughly five pages in the ACM style. Final contributions can be up to 16 LIPIcs pages in length (excluding bibliography) and will be published on the open access <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/publikationen/lipics/" target="_blank">LIPIcs archive</a>.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> The EasyChair submission <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=snapl2017" target="_blank">website</a> is now open.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>

<p>SNAPLâ€™s requirements for submissions are adopted from <a href="http://www.nspw.org/" target="_blank">NSPW</a>, with changes by the SNAPL organizers.  SNAPL draws on the best elements of many successful meeting formats, including the database community's <a href="http://cidrdb.org/" target="_blank">CIDR</a> conference; the various Hot* conferences in systems; the practitioner-leaning Strange Loop; Seminars hosted at Dagstuhl; Working Groups run by IFIP; and *PLS regional programming language events.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>

<p><b>Q:</b> The final version can include up to 16 pages while the CFP asks for an 8-page paper submission (excluding bibliography and cover page). Does this mean that the author is submitting 8 pages out of an eventual 16 page paper?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> No, the author is expected to submit a standalone 8-page paper. This submission is what will be evaluated.  Once the paper is accepted, authors may be asked by the PC to add more material, for a range of typical reasons. It's a bad use of author time to decide what to cut in order to make room for the new material, so we allow the final version to grow substantially.</p>
