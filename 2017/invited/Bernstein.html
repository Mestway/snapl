                      <h2>Physical Simulation using Database Languages</h2>

                      <h4>Gilbert Bernstein</h4>

<p>
(Physical) Simulations are some of the oldest, most computationally intensive, and scientifically critical numerical programs in computing.  The resulting inexhaustible demand for computation leads programmers to employ a large array of different geometric representations, parallel hardware, physical models, and numeric techniques.  But in code, these concerns turn into spaghetti.  Professors attempt to train their students to become super-expert generalists.  Code size balloons.  Code bases ossify.  For instance, porting a simulation from a serial prototype running on a laptop to a fully distributed supercomputer program is estimated to increase code size by 5-10x.  I refer to the problem of being able to separate these concerns and curb combinatorially induced code growth as the “simulation expression problem.”
<br><br>
In work with colleagues, I’ve been exploring the idea that designing high-performance languages built on database concepts—notably relational algebra—can drastically simplify simulation programs.  We’ve found that (1) completely automatic parallelization is possible for broad classes of simulations; (2) complex cyclic mesh data structures can be automatically verified without any proof assistant; (3) code-size can frequently be reduced by an order of magnitude.  The resulting simulations often outperform hand-written code, for the simple reason that most existing code bases make sub-optimal decisions on cross-cutting concerns like data representation or parallelization strategies.
