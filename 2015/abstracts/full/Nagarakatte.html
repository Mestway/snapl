                  <h2>Everything You Want to Know About Pointer-Based Checking</h2>
                  <h4>Santosh Nagarakatte, Milo Martin, Steve Zdancewic</h4>
                  <p>Lack of memory safety in C/C++ has resulted in numerous security
vulnerabilities and serious bugs in large software systems. This paper
highlights the challenges in enforcing memory safety for C/C++
programs and progress made as part of the SoftBoundCETS project. We
have been exploring memory safety enforcement at various levels --- in
hardware, in the compiler, and as a hardware-compiler hybrid --- in
this project. Our research has identified that maintaining metadata
with pointers in a disjoint metadata space and performing bounds and
use-after-free checking can provide comprehensive memory safety.

We describe the rationale behind the design decisions and its
ramifications on various dimensions, our experience with the various
variants that we explored in this project, and the lessons learned in
the process. We also describe and analyze the forthcoming Intel Memory
Protection Extensions~(MPX) that provides hardware acceleration for
disjoint metadata and pointer checking in mainstream hardware, which
is expected to be available later this year.</p>
