                  <h2>Draining the Swamp:  Micro Virtual Machines as Solid Foundation for Language Development</h2>
                  <h4>Kunshan Wang, Yi Lin, Stephen Blackburn, Michael Norrish, Antony Hosking</h4>
                  <p>Many of today's programming languages are broken. Poor performance,
lack of features and hard-to-reason-about semantics can cost dearly in
software maintenance and inefficient execution. The problem is only getting
worse with programming languages proliferating and hardware becoming more
complicated.

An important reason for this brokenness is that much of language
design is implementation-driven. The difficulties in
implementation and insufficient understanding of concepts bake bad
designs into the language itself. Concurrency, architectural
details and garbage collection are three fundamental concerns that
contribute much to the complexities of implementing managed languages.

We propose the \emph{micro virtual machine}, a thin abstraction designed
specifically to relieve implementers of managed languages of the most
fundamental implementation challenges that currently impede good design.
The micro virtual machine targets abstractions over memory (garbage
collection), architecture (compiler backend), and concurrency.  We
motivate the micro virtual machine and give an account of the design 
and initial experience of a concrete instance, which we call Mu, built
over a two year period.  Our goal is to remove an important barrier to
performant and semantically sound managed language design and
implementation.</p>
