                  <h2>Refined Criteria for Gradual Typing</h2>
                  <h4>Jeremy Siek, Michael Vitousek, Matteo Cimini, John Boyland</h4>
                  <p>Siek and Taha [2006] coined the term gradual typing to describe
a theory for integrating static and dynamic typing within a single
language that 1) puts the programmer in control of which regions of
code are statically or dynamically typed and 2) enables the gradual
evolution of code between the two typing disciplines. Since 2006, the
term gradual typing has become quite popular but its meaning
has become diluted to encompass anything related to the integration of
static and dynamic typing. This dilution is partly the fault of the
original paper, which provided an incomplete formal characterization
of what it means to be gradually typed. In this paper we draw a crisp
line in the sand that includes a new formal property, named the
gradual guarantee, that relates the behavior of programs that
differ only with respect to their type annotations.  We argue that the
gradual guarantee provides important guidance for designers of
gradually typed languages. We survey the gradual typing literature,
critiquing designs in light of the gradual guarantee. We also report
on a mechanized proof that the gradual guarantee holds for the
Gradually Typed Lambda Calculus.</p>
